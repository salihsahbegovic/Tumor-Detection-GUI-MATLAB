# Tumor-Detection-GUI-MATLAB
Project task was to make an application with a GUI that will enable the user to detect and isolate tumors on MR scans. Then, by activating certain buttons on the GUI, the app will filter the image in order to remove noise, check whether there is a tumor on the image and will notify the user about that, it will isolate the shape of a tumor as white pixels on a black background, it will show the boundary rectangle of the tumor, it will isolate the borders of the tumor and will color the tumor on the MR image. While creating the app, it was important to take into consideration that the user can at any moment click on any button, therefore the app should be able, at any moment and before or after any button is pressed, to write a corresponding message and continue working.
